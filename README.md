# Dolapo's Website

A cinematic portfolio built from scratch — blending filmmaking and full-stack development.  
Created by **Dolapo Ogunsola**, this project showcases the journey of a self-taught creative and engineer building his vision one frame and one line of code at a time.

## 🚀 Vision

I have a Sony FX30 with the goal to master color grading and to tell stories through films.  
I’m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Spring Boot to build a website that reflects that vision.
